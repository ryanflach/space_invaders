# Space Invaders
A JavaScript implementation of the classic arcade game Space invaders.

This implementation is based on a code-along with Mary Rose Cook, which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIfF0QXeNjM).

## Usage

To install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To fire up a development server:

```
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.

To build the static files:

```js
npm run build
```


To run tests in Node:

```js
npm test
```
